# Auto Marketing Agent — Coffee Shop Project

An autonomous digital marketing pipeline: give it one prompt (e.g. "Create a
Diwali campaign for my coffee shop"), and 7 agents plan, generate, review,
retry if needed, write a caption, and prepare the post — no human steps in
between except the initial prompt.

## Project structure

## How the loop works

```
Planner -> Strategist -> Creative Director -> Image Generator -> Quality Agent
                                                                       |
                                                          approved? --yes--> Content Agent -> Publisher
                                                                       |
                                                                       no (score < 80)
                                                                       |
                                                          back to Creative Director
                                                          (with specific issues to fix)
                                                                       |
                                                          max 3 attempts, then stop
```

## Setup

```powershell
cd backend
copy .env.example .env
# edit .env and paste in your real keys:
#   HF_TOKEN=... (Hugging Face token with accepted FLUX access)
#   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=... and CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=...
#   INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
#   LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=... and LINKEDIN_AUTHOR_URN=...

# Follow backend/GPU_SETUP.md for CUDA PyTorch and font installation first.
pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt
python -m app.gpu_check
```

## Run — Option A: with the UI (recommended)

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --workers 1
```
Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser. Type a prompt, hit Generate,
and watch each agent light up live, including retries if the Quality Agent
rejects an image.

## Run — Option B: from the terminal only

```powershell
python run.py "Create a Diwali campaign for my coffee shop"
```

## What's still a stub (not built yet)

- **Social publishing** — disabled for now. Approved campaigns are saved as
  local drafts with their image, caption, and hashtags; they are not posted to
  Instagram or LinkedIn.
- **Business profile memory** — right now the business profile is hardcoded
  in `run.py` / not yet exposed in the UI. Add a form field or a saved
  profile file so you don't have to re-describe the coffee shop every time.
- **Scheduling / festival auto-detection** — the "look at the calendar and
  auto-launch a campaign" phase from the original plan.

## Security note

Never commit `.env` or paste real API keys anywhere outside your own
machine's environment variables. `.gitignore` is already set up to exclude
`.env` and generated images from git.

GPU inference setup: [backend/GPU_SETUP.md](backend/GPU_SETUP.md). The application now uses local Hugging Face models for text, vision review, and image generation.
